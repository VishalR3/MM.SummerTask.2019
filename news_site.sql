And in the quarter between January and March, it expanded by just 5.8% - falling behind China&#39;s pace for the first time in nearly two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means India is no longer the world&#39;s fastest-growing economy.

According to a government report, unemployment touched a 45-year high between 2017 and 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Joshi believes the government should focus on labour-intensive sectors like construction and textiles to create more immediate jobs, but also give importance to industries like healthcare to generate employment in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The government wants to scale-up its healthcare and welfare schemes, and apart from doctors and surgeons, you also need paramedics and nurses,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weak exports have also been a stumbling block when it comes to creating jobs. The government is expected to prioritise policies that will make small- and medium-sized businesses more competitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spurring consumer demand</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The new GDP data make it clear that India is staring at an economic slowdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike China, India&#39;s economic growth has been driven by domestic consumption over the past 15 years. But data released over the past few months suggest that consumer spending is slowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sales of cars and SUVs have slumped to a seven-year low. Tractor, motorbike and scooter sales are down. Demand for bank credit has sputtered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hindustan Unilever - India&#39;s leading maker of fast-moving consumer goods - has reported slower revenue growth in the past quarter. All of these are important benchmarks for measuring consumer appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A man pushes his motorbike out of a car dealership, on April 14, 2008 in Bangalore, India.\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/D82A/production/_107183355_gettyimages-80725220.jpg\" style=\"height:549px; width:976px\" />Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image captionSales of cars and SUVs have slumped to a seven-year low</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Modi&#39;s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised that it would cut income tax to ensure greater purchasing power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaurang Shetty, vice-president of a brokerage firm, believes that the government should also consider slashing personal and corporate taxes in the next budget, which will be announced in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It will act as a stimulus for the economy,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But India&#39;s 3.4% budget deficit - the gap between government expenditure and revenue - might restrict Mr Modi&#39;s options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts say that the widening fiscal deficit could hold back medium- and long-term growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The agrarian crisis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a constant challenge for Mr Modi in his first term. Farmers across the country regularly protest, demanding higher crop prices and loan waivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BJP has promised to extend a scheme that offers income support for small- and medium-sized farmers to include all farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Income support is a stop-gap arrangement but it is not a long-term solution,&quot; says Mr Joshi, adding that the agrarian sector is in need of structural changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, farmers sell their produce to state-owned agencies at a fixed price.

But many observers say that the gargantuan sum will come from private industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Modi made little progress on his promise to sell government-owned enterprises, including the debt-ridden national carrier Air India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaurang Shetty expects Mr Modi to pursue privatisation more aggressively this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Indian stock markets have been euphoric and the rally is likely to continue for a while. It&#39;s the ideal time to sell stakes in loss-making companies,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts also reckon that embracing bolder policies could entice more foreign investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p076mzqn.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media captionAs unemployment climbs in India, job creation is top of the agenda</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private investment has been lagging for the past few years, and India&#39;s impressive economic growth in the past decade has largely been driven by government expenditure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Mr Modi&#39;s first term, his government reduced red tape, helping move India to 77th spot in the World Bank&#39;s 2019 Doing Business ranking - a vast improvement from its earlier rank of 134.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts say more needs to be done to attract private and foreign investment - and they say that it has to happen quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The first two years is the time to bite the bullet.

All you need is a Pok&eacute;ball of a heart!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/Timeline-01.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>THE ABODE OF NIT ROURKELA</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rourkela- Where it all begins!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Pallet town, Rourkela, often known as Ispat Nagar or the Steel City is an industrial city in the north-western part of Odisha. This Pok&eacute;city and its trainers bask in the blistering yet idyllic summers, reaching the maximum temperature of 49&deg;C as well relish the cosy freezing winters that come down till 4&deg;C. It is well-connected by railways, thanks to the Howrah-Mumbai line passing through it. The &#39;Smart City&#39; is the 3rd largest city in Odisha and boasts of being at the confluence of Koel and Sankha rivers which snake their way through the city to join the mighty Brahmani river. The planned city, which was established way back in 1954, consists of 18 sectors and a few more neighbourhoods connected by the 16-kilometre long Ring Road which runs around the whole city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institute of Technology Rourkela or NIT Rourkela in short, is located in Sector-1 of Rourkela. Nestled in the south-eastern corner of the city, it is flanked by hills on the southern side. The 1024- acre campus houses the hostels, restaurants, faculty residences and sports facilities with the academic area in the middle of the campus. The institute has 3 gates namely the Main Gate (West side), the CWS gate (North side) and the Kantajhar or East Gate. Sector-2, Ispat Market, Ambagan and the Kachery Road serve as the prime shopping areas for all kinds of needs. So trainers buckle yourselves up to explore the Pok&eacute;city and find as many Pok&eacute;mons and batches as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>MANOEUVRING THROUGH BATTLEFIELDS-LOCATING NIT ROURKELA</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To reach Pallet Town, a trainer has many ways. And Rourkela is not an exception. Rourkela is well connected to the world by all the three means - railways, roadways and airways. An AC bus leaves every night from the campus for Bhubaneswar and vice-versa. With a minimal fair of 425/-, the seats can be booked both online and offline. The nearest bus stop is in Sector-2, just a kilometre away from the campus. Convenient intercity and interstate buses run from there to other different cities as well. The railway station is situated 6 km away from the campus, and the autorickshaw fare is a minimum of 120/-. There are also OLA cabs and other rental cabs running through the city for travel convenience. The nearest airports are Jharsuguda, Ranchi, Raipur, and Kolkata (in the increasing order of distance). The newly constructed Jharsuguda airport connects to Kolkata, New Delhi, and Hyderabad and is just two hours away from Rourkela.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The home to trainers as long as they stay in the campus are the Halls of Residence, but before being allotted a hall, you can stay in hotels, inns, and lodges which are available almost everywhere in the city. There is also a Guest House in the campus which requires prior booking and can be booked from the NIT Rourkela site. Staying in the campus guest house provides you easier commute and accessibility to the institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>HANDY UTILITIES AND POK&Eacute;STOPS</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All our newly transformed Pok&eacute;mon trainers need some basic supplies to tackle problems and NIT Rourkela does an excellent job catering to the needs of our Pok&eacute;mon trainers. There are numerous on-campus stores stacked with a wide array of quality products. A complex named &lsquo;<strong>Needs</strong>&#39; located in the proximity of K.M.S Hall of Residence offers grocery, stationary, vegetables along with salon services. Another notable store titled &lsquo;<strong>Rangoli</strong>&#39; is located amid Scholar&#39;s Avenue in front of the GDB Hall of Residence. Apart from these stores,<strong>&nbsp;J.D. Enterprises&nbsp;</strong>and Trainer bookstore, positioned in the academic region supplies for the educational support to power pack the Pok&eacute;mons in their quest of survival. Sector 2 Marketplace, VIP marketplace, Ispat market are some of the local bazaars displaying the authenticity of Rourkela. Apart from local shopping areas, there is a humongous hub of supermarkets, branded showrooms of jewellery, fabrics, and handicrafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A healthy mind stays in a healthy body, and though multifarious and nutritious, the mess food might sometimes become tedious. To all the foodies out there, NIT Rourkela offers us with the many food joints like&nbsp;<strong>Joz Kitchen and Hexagon in the Scholars Avenue, Moksha and Dosa Plaza in Technology Avenue, Rengcol and Srinivas lunch Room in the academic block</strong>. They accept cashless payments and have a trainer-friendly timetable. Ash along with Misty and Brock come to the Nescafe, Amul Parlour, and the Departmental store near the main gate for the perfect hangouts and refreshments after long hours of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NIT Rourkela provides a mesmerising abode to thousands of trainers incoming every year. A walk through the lush green pathway brings the souls to a state of tranquillity. Using a cycle, the campus could be explored by the Pok&eacute;mons. NIT Rourkela aims at maintaining a healthy lifestyle for its trainers. Thus, the Dilip Tirkey Stadium (DTS) and Sachin Tendulkar Sports Complex (STSC) provide exemplary areas for recreation in the territories of sports and athletics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NIT Rourkela wants to establish a regiment of mentally as well as physically fit Pok&eacute;mons. To accomplish that, extra-academic activities such as&nbsp;<strong>NSS, NCC and Physical Education</strong>&nbsp;are introduced in the curriculum of trainers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campus is well equipped with the banking facilities, having one SBI ATMs in front of GDB hall, one SBI ATM near KMS and an Axis bank ATM in the academic area near the Banyan tree. The campus also has three temples inside it. Hold down your Pok&eacute;balls and carry them for the journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a rookie Pokemon trainer, you should always be ready to learn new skills and fight in practice battles. Here are a few tutors of equipment you should possess to lead your training period smooth and hassle-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>GENERAL:-</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>? A bicycle to move around on the campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? An emergency light so that you don&rsquo;t blame power cuts for bad grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? Personal Utilities:- You will need a personal mattress and pillow set for your room and also a bathroom set including a bucket and mug</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? An umbrella and raincoat as the weather of Rourkela are quite uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>STATIONERY:-</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>? Scientific Calculator</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? Notebook and geometry box</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? Lab coat:- Some of the laboratories and workshops require the students to wear a lab coat or apron for their safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>STATIONERY FOR B.ARCH STUDENTS:-</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the things mentioned above, you will need:-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? Architect&rsquo;s Scale:- As the name suggests, yours has to be different from others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? Drawing storage tube:- You can carry your drawing plans in this tube.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? Adjustable Triangle:- Another architect&rsquo;s tool required in drawing plans and stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>TECHNOLOGY AND SOFTWARE:-</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>? A standard laptop with decent RAM and GPU for all kinds of technical work like designing and coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? An ethernet cable to connect your laptop to the institutes&rsquo; LAN access wherever available through which you can access the internet, NITRIS portal, and webmail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the things which you will require day in and day out. Other than these, you should carry a pouch of medicines for common illnesses. You can also bring some packet food like chips or biscuits to satisfy your appetite in an odd time of the day (though the night canteens are plenty to cater to your late appetite). Carrying an electric kettle also comes in handy if you want to heat water or anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>RECONNOITRING THE HALLS OF RESIDENCE</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/IMG_20190529_174222.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attention Pok&eacute;mon trainers! We can&rsquo;t just let you sleep in sleeping bags and cook food for yourselves. Being the second largest engineering institute in India, NIT Rourkela boasts of encompassing 11 Halls of Residence spread across the campus,&nbsp;<strong>7 for boys</strong>&nbsp;(GDB, MV, MSS, DBA, VS, SD, and HB),&nbsp;<strong>2 for girls</strong>&nbsp;(KMS and CVR) and&nbsp;<strong>2 for married scholars</strong>&nbsp;(SSB and VK). You will be exclusively allocated among&nbsp;<strong>GDB, MV (for boys) and KMS (for girls)</strong>for your first year. The Halls of Residence are administered by the&nbsp;<strong>Hall Executive Council</strong>&nbsp;(HEC) comprising of a hierarchy of trainer representatives in the form of secretaries and professors with the role of Warden and Assistant Warden. The Hall Management Council (HMC) is the umbrella organization headed by the Chief Warden that every HEC is answerable to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every hall is divided into numerous blocks constituting of spacious,well-ventilated rooms, properly furnished with modern furniture including bed frames, study tables, chairs, cupboards, tube lights, and ceiling fans. In order to enhance the trainer&rsquo;s exploration capabilities, LAN ports are also installed in every room. There are sufficient washrooms and toilets in each block installed with geysers and exhaust fans whose cleanliness and sanitation are ensured with utmost priority on a daily basis. Every hall of residence harbours a well-ventilated, state-of-the-art mess which serves four healthy and savoury meals a day: breakfast, lunch, evening snacks and dinner whose menu is updated every semester according to the desires of its trainers. Day &amp; night canteens play an integral role for a trainer. These are the places where the trainers gather for a rendezvous and enjoy lip-smacking refreshments and satiate their untimely cravings, i.e. fighting the gym battles. Appraising the gravity of the situation a steady supply of electricity is ensured and water coolers attached to Aqua-guards(purifiers) are also placed in every block and corridor owing to the provision of clean and cold water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Halls of Residence also facilitate common rooms, readings rooms, reasonably attractive gymnasium, games room and TV room as a source of entertainment to eliminate the monotony among the trainers. To encourage them to come out with their remarkable talents, the HMC and HEC also give opportunities to the enthusiasts by organising several inter/intra hall tournaments and competitions that include badminton, cricket, debate, essay writing, etc. Hall days and Garden fests are also organized with provision for flavoursome dishes, disc-jockeys, etc. Many great cultural functions and festivals are also celebrated within the hall premises with great spirit and avidity. Hence at NIT Rourkela, we leave no Pok&eacute;mon trainer unprepared for gym battles, we provide them with enough facilities and help them to be entirely prepared for their future battles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>ACADEMIC EDUVENTURES</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/IMG_20190529_163900.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>GOTTA TRAIN THEM ALL!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Enough of the other stuff trainers! Now comes the part which you all need to pay heed to in depth. If you all wish to bring out the dormant Ash Ketchum inside you, training oneself in different subjects is inevitable. Nothing to be aggrieved for as we are here to further your aspirations by helping you bag your credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After toiling hard and fighting out all the odds, when you end up here at NIT Rourkela, you aim to strive for academic excellence. The coherent academic structure of NIT Rourkela provides you with an edge over others in terms of knowledge and the technical acumen. The academic curriculum in the first year for all branches and disciplines remain the same, mainly comprising theory courses along with some lab sessions and each with a certain number of credits. The theory courses will mostly be lecture sessions with tutorial classes (for some specific subjects). There are two examinations in each semester, one is the&nbsp;<strong>mid-semester</strong>&nbsp;(30%), and the other is the&nbsp;<strong>end semester</strong>&nbsp;(50%) analogous to the Indigo league, held within a gap of two months, with 20% weightage to&nbsp;<strong>teacher&rsquo;s assessment</strong>&nbsp;(TA). The timetable for the classes is quite flexible, classes run from 8 am &ndash; 5:15 pm, with a lunch break from (12 noon to 1:15 pm).&quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&rdquo;- taking into account the gravity of this thing the academic calendar provides the trainers with two long drawn holidays namely&nbsp;<strong>winter (4 weeks), summer (11 weeks)</strong>&nbsp;post the end semester exams, a week-long of Navaratri holidays after the first mid-semester exams and many other occasional leaves for the trainers to relax and rejuvenate. The academic timetable is available on the institute website and decoding the timetable is a skill an NIT Rourkela trainer must possess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NIT Rourkela stands atop all other NITs with the largest number of courses offered to specialise in. With a whopping 22 branches of engineering, MSc and Architecture departments, NIT Rourkela boasts off its rich, ingenious prowess. Up for some training already? The monumental Lecture Annexure (LA) is where you begin and burgeon on. All the theory classes, some lab courses, orientations and induction programmes of the various clubs, branch freshers&rsquo; will be held there. Being a credible trainer demands you to inculcate the lessons learnt from all sorts of training regimes for which attendance is indispensable (a minimum of 85%). Failing to maintain the numbers can result in grade back or debar from a course. The gigantic&nbsp;<strong>Biju Pattnaik Central Library (BPCL)&nbsp;</strong>catalyzes the learning process. From attendance to results, hostel management, academic calendars, exam routines and sitting arrangements, minor degree and branch change rules; your one-stop solution for all such queries is the NITRIS. Zimbra webmail is an open source server which circulates all official emails of NIT Rourkela akin to the Pok&eacute;mails. To ameliorate the process of learning, there is ANKCTEL, our very own e-learning forum. Not to forget sites like NPTEL, Moodle, Coursera, Neso Academy which act as saviour during adverse situations. All of this can be accessed by trainers any time using the Institute LAN equipped in each hostel room.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>CGPA AND SGPA- A TAB ON YOUR SCORES</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Semester Grade Point Average or SGPA is your GPA for only one particular semester, and Cumulative Grade Point Average or CGPA is for all the semesters till now. The process to calculate SGPA is quite simple. Each subject in a particular semester has some credits. The total number of credits will be the sum of credits of all the subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SGPA= sum of (grade point * credit of subject) for each subject/(10 * (sum of credits of all subjects))</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To calculate your CGPA, divide the sum of all your SGPA by sum of credits of all the semesters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*Grade points for each grade is given below in the table.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Grade</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Points</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>Ex</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>10</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>A</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>9</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>B</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>8</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>C</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>7</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>D</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>6</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>P</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>5</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>F</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n			<p>2</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consulting with teachers for the hardships that trainers face, if any, at any point of time is advisable for the trainers. Furthermore, trainers can reach out to the SCP team for any help they need. We wish all the freshmen a merry and healthy learning experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>MINOR DEGREE-TAKING ON AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, more Pokemon is always exciting, and so is your training. On completion of 2nd semester, you can opt for a Minor degree, but the catch is, you&#39;ve got to earn badges to be able to choose one. In other words, you need to fulfil the following conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? The Minor degree will be allocated based on CGPA acquired by the trainer at the end of the first year. The minimum CGPA of 7.50 will be considered eligible for registration for the minor degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? A trainer won&rsquo;t be eligible to opt for a minor degree unless he/she clears the extra-academic courses (PE/NSS) in the first year itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? He/she needs to take at least six additional courses offered by the minor branch department constituting of minimum 18 credits between 3rd&nbsp;and 8th semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? The branch opted for a minor degree is a one-time choice and cannot be altered under any circumstance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? Anyone who wishes to leave the Minor degree in between, he/she may be allowed to do so with the permission of Dean (Ac.). His/her grade-sheet will only reflect the cleared courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? If a trainer fails to complete a Minor degree course within his/her normal duration, he/she has the option to either drop the minor degree or he/she may stay an extra semester or year as applicable to complete the same for the award of Minor degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>BRANCH CHANGE POLICIES</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Meritorious students who secure a minimum CGPA of 8.5 at the end of the first year may be given an option for branch change subject to availability of vacant seats and subject to the condition that the following vacancy created in the parent department due to branch change should not be more than&nbsp;<strong>5%</strong>&nbsp;of the actual strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>MINIMUM CGPA REQUIREMENTS- SURVIVAL AGAINST ALL ODDS:</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not too severe for a pokemon trainer to survive if he/she is dedicated and willing to learn. A minimum CGPA of&nbsp;<strong>6</strong>&nbsp;is mandatory for a student at all times. If his CGPA drops&nbsp;<strong>below 6</strong>, then the following procedure is followed for taking the necessary action:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? A Modified Grade Point Average will be calculated by replacing all the X and F grades by P grade. If the MGPA exceeds six, then the student may be permitted to register for a full suite of higher semester courses at the discretion of the Faculty Advisor. If it doesn&#39;t, he is required to enter the &#39;slow pace&#39; program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? If a student&#39;s CGPA is 6 in 3 consecutive semesters, then he must leave the institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? In case of a first-year student, if the CGPA is&nbsp;<strong>between 5 and 5.69</strong>, he will re-register in the first semester and start the program anew. The CGPA in the repeat year must exceed 6 for the person to stay in the institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>? If CGPA is less than five, the student must leave the institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A student is not permitted to re-register a course when he has scored a P grade or a better grade in it. However, students below 6 CGPA can do so to improve their scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A student who has been debarred from an examination and awarded an &#39;X&#39; grade for any reason may register for the subjects as backlog papers in the following semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who have been awarded unregistered &#39;UR&#39; because of poor attendance or any reason need to register for the course and attend the classes as per rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES-SHARPENING YOUR PSYCHE<em>!</em></strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from having a globally recognised academia, NIT Rourkela has ample opportunities for trainers with different passions. The institute aims for your holistic development, with particular emphasis on critical attributes like leadership skills and ability to work in a team. To realise this noble idea, NIT Rourkela provides a wide range of opportunities for its beloved trainers to excel as Pok&eacute; masters. These facilities include sports, literature, music, dance, acting, debating and many more, a significant part of which comes under the club culture of NIT Rourkela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infrastructure wise, NIT Rourkela is equipped with facilities for all kind of sports:<strong>&nbsp;Dilip Tirkey Stadium (DTS)</strong>&nbsp;is the centre for sports like Football and Hockey;&nbsp;<strong>Sachin Tendulkar Sports Complex (STSC)&nbsp;</strong>is the hub for Cricket, Kho- Kho and Handball;&nbsp;<strong>P.T. Usha Sports Complex</strong>&nbsp;has facilities for sports like Kabaddi, Volleyball, Basketball, and Lawn Tennis. Apart from these, there is a Swimming Pool and a Gymnasium with separate timings for boys and girls. The institute teams of all these sports take part in prestigious national level events including Inter-NIT and IIT fests. Apart from this, the institute also organises inter-hall and intra-hall sporting events throughout the year to nurture your talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The institute organises five major fests every year:<strong>&nbsp;Innovision (technical), NITRutsav (Literary), Cosmopolitan (Cultural), Vriddhi (Sports) and Roots&nbsp;</strong>which brings trainers from different colleges of the country to NIT Rourkela. These fests boast of exhilarating DJ shows, EDM nights, Musical pro shows, fun events and much more. Such fests drain monotonicity out of the life of a trainer at NIT Rourkela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extra-curricular activities at NIT Rourkela play a vital role in shaping the personality of trainers. Making the perfect use of these opportunities should be the primary goal of every trainer after entering the overwhelming Pok&eacute; league of this institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>SAC AND CLUB CULTURE-THE PARAMOUNT ARENA!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/IMG_20190529_165734.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Student Activity Centre - where the Pok&eacute;mon masters reside - of NIT Rourkela is like an assortment of clubs with different clusters of Pok&eacute;mon trainers. It supervises the working of these clubs registered under the four societies; Technical society, Literary society, Cultural society and Games and sports society. These clubs, comprising Pok&eacute;mon trainers, can broaden your area of interests, develop your personality, make your psychological traits more endurable so that you&#39;ll level up and advance as a master in your Pok&eacute;mon battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about 60 clubs specialising in different aspects- Debating, Social, Music, Dance, Technical and many more. The skill and will power to break the status quo and think out of the box is the necessity of every club. All such activities will help the ever-talented person in you bloom and evolve into a powerful trainer just like Ash! Your unbelievably zany college experience can be credited to the unfaltering enthusiasm and the blood, sweat, and tears of the Pok&eacute;mon masters that the SAC confines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>STUDENT COUNSELLING PROGRAM-HUSTLING THROUGH THE GRIND</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Facing a setback with your Pok&eacute;mon? Need a Pok&eacute;mon centre to help you out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worry no more! NIT Rourkela has just the solution for you in its&nbsp;<strong>Student Counseling Program</strong>&nbsp;(abbreviated as SCP). Founded by the present Director, Prof Animesh Biswas, the program plans to ensure that the freshmen have a flawless transition into the new way of life that awaits them at NIT Rourkela. It further aids them in building up a confident attitude towards their present and subsequent problems, so they become Ultimate Pok&eacute;mon trainers and later Pok&eacute;mon champions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It includes eight faculty members with Prof KC Pati as the Professor in Charge and 11 trainer coordinators. Are you wondering how the trainer coordinators are any different from you? Well, they are the experienced Pok&eacute;mon trainers who have already earned their gym badge and are in their sophomore year or higher up. They assign each trainer coordinator a set of &quot;mentors&quot; within a week of admission who take care of the freshmen or the &quot;mentees&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experienced mentors interact with the freshmen to provide personal and professional support and help them conquer the initial obstacles. The teams also intend to resolve any ambiguities regarding extra-curricular activities as well as the monetary issues of the pupils. Since all pupils may not be acquainted with the learning pace and sequence, remedial classes are carried out by the SCP to traverse the gap. It also holds bridge courses for overseas trainers to familiarise them with the learning system of the institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homesickness, discomfort, psychological anguish, and peer pressure add to the academic stress that the newbies face in NIT Rourkela. Thus SCP has appointed psychiatrists to confront the menace of mental stress.

The security officers here have the same spirit as Officer Jenny and Growlithe. For any academic entanglement, get the problem responded at the Assistant Registrar&rsquo;s office. Webmails, alike to Pok&eacute;mails, to gym trainers, are an effective means for Pok&eacute;mon trainers to get their queries clarified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you seemed lost with a bunch of suspicions, your genial seniors are always there to assist you. Do approach them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Strong Pok&eacute;mon, Weak Pok&eacute;mon. That is only the prejudiced perception of people. Fairly proficient trainers should try to conquer with all their picks.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>THE BATTLE FINALE OF PLACEMENTS</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Meowth had realized,&quot;&nbsp;<em>I see now that the circumstances of one&#39;s birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.</em>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/IMG_20190529_171947.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reach the crescendo of your adventure to become an engineer, fighting battles and winning badges, you will have to sail through the climactic battle of Placements to win your ultimate champions trophy. Getting into NIT Rourkela is in itself a catch 22 and once you are through that phase, summon all your spirits to get paid back by luring companies across various top-notch sectors coming for campus recruitments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at the statistics, the infamous&nbsp;<strong>Training and Placement Cell&nbsp;</strong>of NIT Rourkela along with its diligent placement coordinators do an astounding work to invite some eminent companies to the campus, justifying the elitist status of the institute in the country with a target per cent placement record making the institute secure a rank within 401-500 in the Times World University rankings for Higher Education under the &ldquo;Engineering and Technology&rdquo; category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the esteemed mass recruiters, the institute also invites some of the prestigious companies to the campus under core as well as non-core sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The institute also has provisions for start-ups and higher studies. To create an environment where trainers are free to mould their future,&nbsp;<strong>Foundation for Technology and Business Incubation (FTBI)</strong>&nbsp;has been housed under Centre for&nbsp;<strong>Technology Innovation and Industry Relations (TIIR)</strong>&nbsp;which has given birth to many start-ups among which Dekho Market is one of the emerging incubations. The campus has witnessed start-ups like MySmartprice, Phoenix Robotics, Penny India and more!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trainers at NIT Rourkela have cracked CAT, GATE and others to become superior league leaders!. To enlist some recent badge-winners, Nihal Chandra Das secured AIR 8, Ritesh Kumar AIR 13 and Kapil Kumar Sharma AIR 41 in GATE 2019. NIT Rourkela also provides an ideal platform for some of the research aspirants who get remunerative offers from countries like Germany, Canada, Japan etc. through DAAD, MITACS and other programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>ALUMNI RELATIONS</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Oak, Red and Alain are very successful Pok&eacute;mon trainers; many Pok&eacute;mon trainers always seek to mature like them. NIT Rourkela has an intelligible tie with its alumni. The alumni serve as brand ambassadors who remain engaged and keep abreast on the progress of the Institute. The academic experience with world-class infrastructure and excellent faculty here at NIT Rourkela has endured our alumni with lifelong career excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>NIT Rourkela Alumni Association, NITRAA</strong>, one of the largest alumni organisation of the country, congregates the alumni from all edges across the globe. The NITRAA&rsquo;s executive council is presided over by Venkata Narasimham Peri. NITRAA conducts its annual inductions to restore trainer-alumni relations through which it persuades the Pok&eacute;mon trainers to heighten their career. Here are few of the many Pok&eacute;mon champions who concede themselves to be examples for the world to witness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>?&nbsp;<strong>Akash Khurana</strong>: a remarkable theatre artist, and an entrepreneur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>?&nbsp;<strong>Soma Mandal</strong>: the First Woman Commercial Director of SAIL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>?&nbsp;<strong>CP Gurnani</strong>: the CEO and Managing Director of Tech Mahindra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>?&nbsp;<strong>Ranjan Dash</strong>: the founder and Chief Technology Officer of Y-Carbon, USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>INSTITUTE STANDING DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE- A LEGION OF STEADFASTNESS</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every trainer needs a safe and malpractice-free league to hone their battle skills. So, the Senate of NIT Rourkela has formed a formidable committee of masters, professors and a couple of student coordinators to regulate disciplinary actions in the institute and even penalise defaulting students trying to use fraudulent means. So, new trainers, feel free to call out academic or professional derelicts if you ever come across one for ISDC to regulate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>MONDAY MORNING-TAKING COGNIZANCE OF NIT ROURKELA</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We, at Monday Morning, the official media body and Pok&eacute;dex of NIT Rourkela, strive to be the ideal interface between the trainer community and the administration by transparently and accurately portraying the opinions, ideas and grievances faced by the trainers publicly.

To house your cycles, every hall is connected to a well-maintained and spacious&nbsp;<strong>cycle stand</strong>&nbsp;provided with air-pump. GDB and MV have a combined cycle-stand maintained by a worker. Workers are recruited to look after them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Guards are posted on the main entrances of each hall.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Hall Management:&nbsp;</strong>Each hall has an effective&nbsp;<strong>Hall Executive Council&nbsp;</strong>comprising a Hall Warden, an Assistant Hall Warden, and a few student elected secretaries. Whenever you face any technical issue, you only need to inform about that to anyone of these people and then it is only a matter of time to fix that. All the HECs work under the umbrella organisation of&nbsp;<strong>Hall Management Council&nbsp;</strong>headed by Chief Warden.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Aesthetics and Hall Events:</strong>&nbsp;Life at every hostel has its own pulses with various events throughout the year, including the inter-hall and intra-hall competitions, Garden Fests, and the Hall Foundation Day. The gardens and lawns of each hall are well-maintained by a group of gardeners and other workers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>G.D. BIRLA HALL OF RESIDENCE</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>GDB is undoubtedly one of the finest hostels in the campus of NITR, which presently accommodates almost 400 boarders that include undergraduates, postgraduates, and a few Ph.D. scholars as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/GDB.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole plan is divided into three blocks: namely A, B and C.The buildings of A and B blocks are three-storeyed while C block is four-storeyed. The blocks are interconnected on each floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hall has a decorated garden where the Garden feast and the Hall Day arrangements are held. Some new benches have been installed near the badminton courts and in the garden as well, thus serving as a new hangout spot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>MV HALL OF RESIDENCE</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Rendering abode to the freshman boys, MV Hall of Residence is located on the Scholar&rsquo;s Avenue, like its immediate neighbour, GDB Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan of the hall divides the accommodation into three blocks: A, B, and C. Each block is three storied and the blocks are interconnected on each floor. According to the previous year stats, the first years were placed in the A and B blocks; the C block was mainly populated with postgraduates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/MV.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hall houses a Juice Centre within the C block to encourage healthy diet among the boarders. Recently in March, a well-equipped Gym was inaugurated within the hall to promote fitness. If you&rsquo;re wishing for a congenial atmosphere that brims with life and dynamism, then MV Hall of Residence is the place for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>C.V. RAMAN HALL OF RESIDENCE&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Housing around 900 boarders in approximately 700 rooms, CV Raman Hall of Residence is easily the largest women&rsquo;s accommodation at NITR. With buildings as high as the fourth storey, this hall of residence is shared by women of all years of undergraduate, postgraduate and doctorate programs. Positioned right beside the&nbsp;<strong>Central Gym and the Swimming Pool</strong>, CVR hall provides nifty infrastructure and quarters with scenic views, aesthetic walkaways and resplendent lawns to its dwellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/2.jpeg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hall is comfortably situated at a very walkable distance from the department buildings of Biotechnology, Food Processing, Industrial Design and Chemical Engineering. Along with a Basketball court and a Badminton court located on the hostel grounds, CVR provides a millennial style living to its boarders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>K.M.S. HALL OF RESIDENCE</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Away from the hustle and bustle of&nbsp; Scholar&rsquo;s Avenue, KMS is located in the vicinity of the campus Dispensary, the NEEDS market complex and the main gate of the campus. The KMS Hall of Residence is acclaimed to be one of the most sought-after hostels for girls. KMS accommodates about 400 boarders in the four blocks, namely A, B, C and D. While the B-Block is specifically allotted to the freshmen, the other blocks have a diversity in its occupants including sophomores, pre-final year undergraduates, postgraduates and doctorate scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/KMS.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extracurricular activities like Zumba dancing and yoga are conducted in the Common Room regularly. Besides, the hall also gives ground to a badminton court in front of the B-block and a basketball court in the courtyard. KMS has an efficient and approachable management staff that looks into the matters, repairs the equipment and resolves disputes. All said and done, this hall has everything it takes to make for a secure and pleasurable stay for any boarder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very encouraging and cheerful student-environment prevails in the hostels which undoubtedly plays an important role in making the freshers&#39; life more comfortable and soothing with a home-like feeling. Each of the hostels is like a city within itself where a healthy student-authority interaction make you feel as a part of a family of the boarders.</p>\r\n', 'Hostellife.jpg', 3, '2019-06-10 18:34:12', 0, 0, 0, 0);

Biswal (director of NIT Meghalaya and program general chair for the conference), Professor S.K Patel (Registrar-in-charge of NITR), Professor B.B.V.L Deepak(Chairman of the conference) and Professor D.R.K Parhi(Program convenor) . This was followed immediately by a keynote lecture by Prof. Kaushik Kumar from BITS Mesra on&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Virtual manufacturing&rsquo;</strong>. It talked about how the customer customises and manufactures a product virtually using technology. There were nine technical sessions on the first day of the event with three going on in B.B.A, Senate Hall and the Mechanical Seminar Hall in parallel. The sessions were hosted by Student coordinator,&nbsp;<strong>Amruta Rout.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second day embarked on a high note with a keynote lecture on&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Models that surround us&rsquo; by D.S Bisht</strong>, Assistant Professor of ID Department. There were two technical sessions in B.B.A and the Senate Hall held in parallel. After that, the Valedictory was held in the afternoon with a delay of half an hour because of some technical issues faced with the microphone in the auditorium. The Valedictory session began with a speech by Prof. Deepak who talked about the great turn out for the event and thanked everyone for making it a success. He commented that there were 110 research papers presented including one international paper presented from Nigeria. He ended his speech by opening the floor for any suggestions on how the event could improve and took necessary feedback. Subsequently, the student coordinators were handed out certificates by Prof. D.R.K Parhi( Program convenor). Following that, Professors were called upon to collect conference gifts for attending as a technical chair during the conference by B.B&nbsp; Biswal.<strong>&nbsp;Prof. D.S Bisht and Prof Kaushik Kumar</strong>&nbsp;were awarded for acting as technical chair and for being the keynote speakers. Finally, 11 best research papers were selected among 8 research tracks and prizes were given to the best research paper in every session by Prof. D.R.K Parhi. The session ended with a speech by Prof. B.B Biswal who thanked all the delegates for turning up and the Professors involved as they didn&rsquo;t leave any stone unturned to make it a success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Valedictory session was followed by a local bus tour around Rourkela for all the delegates and the event was drawn to a successful conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amruta Rout had the following to say about the event:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Since we were organising it for the first time, it was very difficult as very few people are there in the ID department but we successfully arranged the first-ever international conference for the Industrial Design&nbsp;department due to the relentless hard work of M.Tech, PhD students and the professors</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference saw a great turn out, receiving 138 research articles (including international papers from China and Nigeria) for a presentation that are to be published in Springer books series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prof. Kaushik Kumar,</strong>&nbsp;who was also the second author of a research paper presented, had the following views about the conference:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Different conferences have different venues. So, people usually attend conferences for the venue&rsquo;s historical importance and not necessarily for the conference. There were many presenters who turned up from all around the country despite the summer heat and in spite of Rourkela not being a tourist spot, thus making the conference a tremendous success. Recently, I got design patents for two of my projects. This conference was very relevant to the Mechanical department and my field of work, i.e. product development.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ICIPDIMS was primarily on innovative product development and processing and also how it plays an important role in the current scenario.</strong>&nbsp;This forms a very important part of Industry 4.0 as the customer needs a customised and unique product. It recognises that the need of the hour is a product that is modified to match the needs of a customer as a product that doesn&#39;t owe any distinctive significance to them is not satisfactory. The summer of 2019 in Rourkela had a lot more to offer than just unbearable heat and overpowering humidity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/PHOTO-2019-05-24-15-46-04.jpg\" /></p>\r\n', 'PHOTO-2019-05-24-15-46-02.jpg', 3, '2019-06-10 18:35:26', 0, 7, 0, 0),

We have come across roadmaps to tackle burning issues like malnutrition through functional food and also fortified product manufacturing. We also aim to develop such an engineering mechanism in our department.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference also awarded the three best oral presentations and poster presentations along with best abstracts from each theme. A grateful&nbsp;<strong>Prof. Sabyasachi Mishra</strong>&nbsp;said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The conference is a major event in the advent of the Food Security Act of the government. Adding sustainability to the cause makes it all the more crucial. Looking at the food wastage due to urbanization and population rise, the best way to tackle this is minimizing wastage in agricultural production as well as processed food. We should come up with deliberations towards developing infrastructure to address these issues. After all these sessions in the conference, we can surely help develop such ideas and mechanisms, particularly product development, packaging and storage among key areas.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Key-note speakers&nbsp;<strong>Prof. S.N Nayak</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Prof. H.N Mishra&nbsp;</strong>spoke to Monday Morning about a successful seminar highlighting necessitated food safety engineering and enhancing production engineering. Prof. Nayak talked about his ventures in developing &lsquo;Green Solvent&rsquo; to curb toxic effluents and isolate food preservatives, artificial colouring and flavours in the food processing industry and scale up new advancing technology in the field of food processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prof. Mishra</strong>&nbsp;said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>NIT Rourkela, by organizing this conference, has taken the right step in a right direction because nowadays the country is facing a turmoil in food and nutritional security owing to umpteen reasons like improper por poor infrastructure, improper handling and storage that leads to wastage of product. So, post-harvest management and value additions are the prime challenges in the food processing sector. If we can save up to 5% of this wastage we can contribute tremendously to our national and rural economy. The 2-day deliberations and recommendations made in this conference by young researchers and fellows will be forthcoming to help improve the situation.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference was sponsored by&nbsp;<strong>NSERB India, Dept. of Science &amp; Technology (Govt. of India), KK Lifesciences, Quebec Analytica, Khera, Future Solutions Inc., Aztech, Sri Ram Mahabir Prasad and Jagannath Printers &amp; Publishers.</strong></p>\r\n', '20190518_122733.jpg', 3, '2019-06-10 18:36:45', 0, 0, 0, 0),

Monday Morning brings you the story of Soumya Pratap Tripathy, who managed to survive to engineering&nbsp;along with his tremendous works in the research fields of his passion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: Brief us about your childhood and schooldays.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:&nbsp;</strong>I am an inhabitant of Odisha, and I hail from&nbsp;<strong>Bhadrak.</strong>&nbsp;My educational background was entirely in Odia medium schools. After my intermediate, I decided to take a year off and moved to Bhubaneshwar for AIPMT preparations.&nbsp;<strong>Engineering was never a choice for me</strong>. Unluckily, I couldn&rsquo;t make it for medical and with a not-so-good rank, landed up in Biotechnology Engineering at NIT Rourkela. As a child, I had a habit of splitting household devices and knowing about how things work and always wanted to serve my Nation. I spent a lot of time pursuing my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: How have these four years been at college, both personally and professionally?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>&nbsp;I had a jolly time here for the last four years of my life. My life turning point was meeting&nbsp;<strong>Prof. Sirsendu Sekhar Ray</strong>. He is a very innovative professor and&nbsp;<strong>the discourse of his thoughts and ideas are quite productive</strong>. Prof. Ray treated me not less than his son, and I obeyed his path. He is my source of inspiration and I had a glorious time working with him.&nbsp;<strong>The Anatomy and Physiology labs were my places of hibernation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing that annoyed me here, was the&nbsp;<strong>strict attendance policy</strong>, which brought me&nbsp;<strong>21-grade backs</strong>&nbsp;during my entire B.Tech career. The attendance is stringent than necessary and that began to pester me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/WhatsApp%20Image%202019-05-28%20at%2016.01.03.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: Talking about your prestigious acceptance at MIT, walk us through your motivation for applying to MIT.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:&nbsp; I had made up my mind to probe deep into the line of research from the beginning itself.</strong>&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t have any personal motive to join MIT. All I yearned a good platform to satisfy my craving for research.&nbsp;<strong>Prof. Ray was driving force behind this</strong>&nbsp;without whose assistance; this achievement would have been far less than even a dream. He was fascinated with the research opportunities afforded there at MIT, and so was I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: Brief us about the application procedure. How was the feeling when you finally received the acceptance letter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:&nbsp;</strong>In my case, there was&nbsp;<strong>no necessity of GRE and the score of IELTS was waved off.</strong>&nbsp;This procedure of application differs from branch to branch. I had&nbsp;<strong>applied through their online portal and chose the research group of my interest</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>The application was out by December. I went through 4 skype interviews and 4 weekly assignments were assigned to me</strong>. I explicated the documentation of all my research projects, all conference presentations, and patents in my first interview.&nbsp;<strong>The 4 assignments were based on the problem statements on which I will be working.</strong>&nbsp;The interviews were basically focused on explaining the proposed solution to the given problem statements in the assignment. After going through all the interviews and assignments, the Professor offered me a PhD position at her lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: What other colleges did you apply for? What were the major reasons for choosing MIT?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>&nbsp;For Ph.D., I had not applied for any other colleges. However, I had applied for Stanford University for a one-year entrepreneurial program: Bio-design program. I was refused as they only accepted graduates and doctorate applicants from top-notch colleges. The environment of MIT was really appreciative which was the sole reason for choosing MIT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: What would be your major role over there? What are your research interests?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:&nbsp;</strong>Mostly, I will be working as&nbsp;<strong>a graduate researcher for two years and doctorate researcher for 5 years. My research field will be based on a brain-computer interface. We will be making a living cyborg. The animal will carry microchips integrated into the neurons in their brain so that we can track the neural activity in real time. It incorporates brain mapping and modelling.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;My research interests twirl around spintronics in biology, the effect of fundamental particles in the biological phenomenon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/WhatsApp%20Image%202019-05-28%20at%2015.59.36%20%281%29.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: What kind of preparations or what are the prerequisites for getting admitted to MIT?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST: They mainly look after your attitude towards research. Proper documentation of your works like patents, research publications, presentations plays a key role in getting into.</strong>&nbsp;I received the offer as I possessed the right skill sets to contribute to the future project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: You have worked immensely on Bio-glass and Graphene Quantum Dots. Tell us something about the same.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST: In the year 2017, I along with my team members, Swati Mohapatra, Soumyashree Jena, Kritideepan Parida,&nbsp;Pranjali Mishra and Megha Satpathy, participated in the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Engineering Students Innovation Challenge held by the International Society for Scientific Research and Development (ESIC-ISSRD) 2017, and we presented the project on the Extraction of Graphene Quantum Dots</strong>&nbsp;from various reliable sources and it has a wide application in orthopaedic, dentistry, high-intensity laser applications. We discovered a unique method for the purification of Glass Quantum Dots through vapour phase transmission and have patents on the same.&nbsp;<strong>Our team won the Best Project Award at National Level for the same.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/WhatsApp%20Image%202019-05-28%20at%2015.59.36%20%282%29.jpeg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: Along with such a strong hold on research, you are running a start-up as well. Tell us about the same.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:&nbsp;</strong>We started our startup,&nbsp;<strong>FLUORO Q&nbsp;</strong>in 2017 under the guidance of Prof. Ray. He always had a dream of introducing his products to the commercial sector. Keeping in mind, the demand for graphene, we decided to use graphene dots in our products. We are now in the position of registering our company. Due to the shortage of time and manpower, we couldn&#39;t start it properly. The monetary sources are the main constraints.&nbsp;<strong>Our team includes- Anup Sunni Routray, Kritideepan Parida, Binay Priyadarshan Nayak, Abhijeet Sahoo, Sashwat Lenka, Kuna Das.</strong>&nbsp;They all have expertise in various fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: Talk us about the curriculum and prospects of Biotechnology Engineering at NITR. How do you feel the improvement can take place?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:&nbsp;</strong>The professors need to be a bit indulgent and give students their own space. They should boost the students to achieve more.&nbsp;<strong>The pattern of teaching greatly affects the student&rsquo;s life. The attendance system needs to be a bit flexible</strong>. While the curriculum is decent, it should mainly focus on practical approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like in my 2nd year, I approached many professors with lucrative ideas, but they denied. This was one more discouraging factor that I could spot out. People like me, who didn&rsquo;t have the facilities required at first, have to find their own way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/WhatsApp%20Image%202019-05-28%20at%2015.59.36.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: What are your future plans?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>My chief intention is to bring the products and technology from lab bench to market</strong>. I will be continuing with my startup and wish to contribute to society in a useful manner, meeting the basic objective of the research.&nbsp;<strong>A few years down the line, I see myself as a successful entrepreneur.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: What message would you like to give our readers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ST:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Do not waste your time.

(29, 'REVOLUTIONIZING LIFE SCIENCES AND DISEASE BIOLOGY: ANUJ TIWARI', 'REVOLUTIONIZING-LIFE-SCIENCES-AND-DISEASE-BIOLOGY-ANUJ-TIWARI', '<p><strong>European Molecular Biology Organization or EMBO</strong>&nbsp;is a professional organization of more than 1,800 life scientists. Its goal is to promote research in life sciences and enable international exchange between scientists. It organizes workshops, courses, conferences, publishes scientific journals and supports individual scientists and projects. Recently, it conducted a conference in Xiu Ning, China from 11-14 April 2019 with the theme&nbsp;<strong>&#39;Membrane shaping and remodelling of proteins.&#39;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Anuj Tiwari</strong>, one of the PhD scholars from the&nbsp;<strong>Department of Life Science&nbsp;</strong>participated in the prestigious conference. Anuj has been immensely contributing in the fields of Biochemistry, disease biology, membrane modelling and shaping of proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born and brought up in Nagpur, Anuj Tiwari had completed his Bachelors and Masters in Biochemistry from the same city. He interned at Biocon, a pharmaceutical company based in Bangalore for a year. Later, his inclinations towards Biological Sciences made him pursue the Doctoral course in the Life Science Department at NIT Rourkela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monday Morning(MM): You attended the conference in China conducted by EMBO, tell us about the conference.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anuj Tiwari(AT):&nbsp;</strong>It was a very important conference in our field which is based on membranes. Membranes are the barriers which protect the organelles from outside and compartmentalize the entire cell. The conference was about the different types of proteins which deform or model the membrane in different ways. Membranes are often ignored and considered static but in reality, they play a significant role in the Cell structure and overall dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, I received a travel grant from EMBO based on the abstract I sent. After screening the submitted abstracts, they awarded travel awards to different participants from different countries. So my travel and accommodation were taken care of by the conference. Along with this, the institute will be reimbursing me half of the registration fees.&nbsp;<strong>The conference was attended by scholars from most of the developed countries like UK, US, Australia, Japan, China itself, Israel, Germany and many others.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/IMG-20190529-WA0007.jpeg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: Share your overall experience at the conference.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AT:</strong>&nbsp;In the conference, I presented a poster and a small flash talk.&nbsp; The poster revolved around the intricacies of&nbsp;<strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</strong>&nbsp;The topic for my presentation was based on Amyloid beta-40 mediated aggregation neuronal cell membrane. In the posters, we showed some of the bio-meiotic model membrane systems that we used for the screening. So we are at a phase where we synthetically make the biological cell membranes and it doesn&rsquo;t consist any of the organelles and observe how our protein of interest (which in my case was Amyloid beta-40) affects the structure of the membranes. There are many other proteins which affect the structure of proteins and in some cases are responsible for some diseases like Hepatitis-B.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall experience was great where I got an opportunity to meet like-minded scholars working in the research areas of my interest. I faced many problems because of the language and being a vegetarian, my issues were amplified. I relied on Google translate for most of the interactions but again because of most of the Google facilities like Google maps, Gmail and others are banned in China, I had a difficult time as well. The conference was in Xiang Ming Hotel in Huangshan city and was organized by the&nbsp;<strong>Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: What are you currently researching on?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AT:</strong>&nbsp;I am currently working on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. It is a late-onset disease: something which happens at a very old age. There are basically two pathophysiological factors through which this disease happens. One is Amyloid Plaques and other is neurofibrillary entanglements. I am working on the Amyloid part. With the passage of time, a particular peptide aggregate gets collected in the brain. This aggregation leads to neural cell death and eventually results in Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: Are there any other conferences you are looking forward to?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AT:&nbsp;</strong>Since my PhD. is about to be completed, I may not get a chance to attend any more conferences. If I get time I would attend a conference in Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://mondaymorning.nitrkl.ac.in/uploads/media/IMG-20190529-WA0008.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MM: What would be your message to our readers?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AT:</strong>&nbsp;If you want to do something good in life, just keep on putting efforts silently.

Finally, the dreaded time came and at 12 AM I mustered up the courage to log in into NITRIS. But the server was down and the result wasn&rsquo;t displayed. &ldquo;Too much traffic perhaps&rdquo;, I thought to myself and tried to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;15 minutes later texts from friends came pouring in. Everyone other than me knew their results. I tried to log in again, but no avail. So I asked a friend about how she got her results and turns out, it wasn&rsquo;t through NITRIS. Her exact words were&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;one of our batchmates has the grade cards. Talk to him and you will get your grade card.

But we are missing out on a bigger picture, why isn&rsquo;t the security of the database up to the mark? Why didn&rsquo;t the person-in-charge think twice about professional ethics before handing out information to a student? How can an eminent institute which prides itself over the technical geniuses it houses, not have the basic security to protect its information system from its own students?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we start the blame game, it is important to know what implications this could have. Sensitive information like this can be used for ragging, bullying or defamation since many students have insecurities about their academic performance.&nbsp;<strong>There</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is also the probability that someone can access records in the future since a person who has found his way along with the database once can surely figure it out again</strong>. A security breach like this puts the institute and the students at the&nbsp;<strong>risk of hacking and data manipulation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blaming someone isn&rsquo;t the end of this matter, taking up responsibility and learning the proper lesson is important. On the surface, the security system feels secure but incidents like this bring out the deep-rooted issues which remain hidden until someone takes unfair advantage. Looks like campus security isn&rsquo;t the only security we should worry about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Some readers might question why the names were blurred. The intention of this write-up is not to punish anyone for their mistakes.
