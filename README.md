#MM.SummerTask.2019----
The Task is to make A Full Fledged News Website.
The Website will contain:
A homepage which lists all the recent articles.
●An article page which will display the content of an article; this page should show the corresponding article when a link is clicked on the homepage 
●Commenting feature which will allow subscribers/admins to comment on the articles (and if you want, you can implement reply feature as well) 
●An Admin Panel with following features ○Admin login page 
○Add/Edit/Delete article page ○Comment Approval/Deletion page (Comments made by admins are automatically approved) 
○A page for adding poll questions (and options) 
●A ​registration page (or modal) ​for the subscribers (Subscribers should not be allowed to log in to the Admin Panel) 
●A ​poll system ​which will show question and options. The vote should be casted immediately as the user clicks vote button after selecting an option. (The page should not reload for submitting the vote. Use AJAX for this. After submission, you may show the opinion percentage for each option). 
●A ​search box ​on the Navbar of the website to search the articles 
●Make RESTful APIs for the different modules of the website. Use appropriate REST URL format for accessing the APIs (Using routing feature of CodeIgniter for this). The API should return the response in JSON format.
